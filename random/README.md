Examples from [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/10/), but written shaders in WGSL and own implementations.

Uses sine-fract PRNG as suggested from the chapter, but other PRNGs could be implemented later. The implementation is provided by [babylon-wgsl](https://github.com/inhibitor1217/babylonjs-wgsl).
